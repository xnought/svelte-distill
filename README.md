# Svelte Distill Template

This is a library that ports the Distill HTML template into svelte styled components.

## Use

Visit [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-distill) for more info.

```bash
npm i svelte-distill
```

Then you can import a component like

```javascript
import { Distill, } from "svelte-distill";
```

You can do the same for the other components that are used in the demo at
`src/App.svelte`. Look at `src/App.svelte` for use cases and how to use each component!

Side Note: the .bib file must be in `public`.
